I went to Devonshire with the\nconviction that Fitzroy Simpson was the true culprit, although,\nof course, I saw that the evidence against him was by no means\ncomplete. It was while I was in the carriage, just as we reached\nthe trainer\u2019s house, that the immense significance of the curried\nmutton occurred to me.

Powdered opium\nis by no means tasteless. The flavour is not disagreeable, but it\nis perceptible. Were it mixed with any ordinary dish the eater\nwould undoubtedly detect it, and would probably eat no more. A\ncurry was exactly the medium which would disguise this taste. By\nno possible supposition could this stranger, Fitzroy Simpson,\nhave caused curry to be served in the trainer\u2019s family that\nnight, and it is surely too monstrous a coincidence to suppose\nthat he happened to come along with powdered opium upon the very\nnight when a dish happened to be served which would disguise the\nflavour. That is unthinkable. Therefore Simpson becomes\neliminated from the case, and our attention centres upon Straker\nand his wife, the only two people who could have chosen curried\nmutton for supper that night. The opium was added after the dish\nwas set aside for the stable-boy, for the others had the same for\nsupper with no ill effects. Which of them, then, had access to\nthat dish without the maid seeing them?"),(0,h.kt)("p",null,"\u201cBefore deciding that question I had grasped the significance of\nthe silence of the dog, for one true inference invariably\nsuggests others.

Obviously the midnight visitor was some one\nwhom the dog knew well."),(0,h.kt)("p",null,"\u201cI was already convinced, or almost convinced, that John Straker\nwent down to the stables in the dead of the night and took out\nSilver Blaze. For what purpose? For a dishonest one, obviously,\nor why should he drug his own stable-boy? And yet I was at a loss\nto know why. There have been cases before now where trainers have\nmade sure of great sums of money by laying against their own\nhorses, through agents, and then preventing them from winning by\nfraud. Sometimes it is a pulling jockey. Sometimes it is some\nsurer and subtler means. What was it here? I hoped that the\ncontents of his pockets might help me to form a conclusion."),(0,h.kt)("p",null,"\u201cAnd they did so. You cannot have forgotten the singular knife\nwhich was found in the dead man\u2019s hand, a knife which certainly\nno sane man would choose for a weapon. It was, as Dr. Watson told\nus, a form of knife which is used for the most delicate\noperations known in surgery. And it was to be used for a delicate\noperation that night. You must know, with your wide experience of\nturf matters, Colonel Ross, that it is possible to make a slight\nnick upon the tendons of a horse\u2019s ham, and to do it\nsubcutaneously, so as to leave absolutely no trace. A horse so\ntreated would develop a slight lameness, which would be put down\nto a strain in exercise or a touch of rheumatism, but never to\nfoul play.\u201d"),(0,h.kt)("p",null,"\u201cVillain!

But in examining his belongings I was fortunate\nenough to discover not only the method of the crime, but even its\nmotives. As a man of the world, Colonel, you know that men do not\ncarry other people\u2019s bills about in their pockets. We have most\nof us quite enough to do to settle our own. I at once concluded\nthat Straker was leading a double life, and keeping a second\nestablishment. The nature of the bill showed that there was a\nlady in the case, and one who had expensive tastes. Liberal as\nyou are with your servants, one can hardly expect that they can\nbuy twenty-guinea walking dresses for their ladies. I questioned\nMrs. Straker as to the dress without her knowing it, and having\nsatisfied myself that it had never reached her, I made a note of\nthe milliner\u2019s address, and felt that by calling there with\nStraker\u2019s photograph I could easily dispose of the mythical\nDerbyshire."),(0,h.kt)("p",null,"\u201cFrom that time on all was plain.

Simpson in his\nflight had dropped his cravat, and Straker had picked it up\u2014with\nsome idea, perhaps, that he might use it in securing the horse\u2019s\nleg. Once in the hollow, he had got behind the horse and had\nstruck a light; but the creature frightened at the sudden glare,\nand with the strange instinct of animals feeling that some\nmischief was intended, had lashed out, and the steel shoe had\nstruck Straker full on the forehead.
